A concept project intended to be used as a database for a browser game, although it was ultimately found to be impractical for this purpose. Though, the project was successful in making an example request-response service. 
Storing player data for browser games can be an expensive task for a small developer. I wanted to find a zero-cost solution so I could develop a fun, open world, Minecraft-esque game as a passion project. The concept was that you could sign in with your google account, giving google sheets API permission, allowing the game data to be stored on your personal google account; a decentralized solution. Ultimately the sheets API request and speed limits made it impractical for this purpose. 


To run:

1. Download the project.
2. Have node installed
3. run ```node back.js```
4. connect to localhost:8080 in your browser
